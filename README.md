# Disclaimer
This is not a engine nor a framework, it is written code/scripts taken from the 2013 Christian Whitehead Version of Sonic 1/2, and then rewritten to work with the GameMaker Language. (For the Pre-built Package, and somewhat for the Base Code) Though you are free to edit it in your preferred coding language.

Also, For said Pre-built Package, you ***must backup your work as it assumes you never edited the following***
- Character Code
- Player Code
- Scripts for Handling Loading/Saving
- ETC
