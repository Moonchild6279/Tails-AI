# Tails AI for Orbitnaut Framework
A addon for the Sonic Gamemaker Engine "Orbinaut Framework" developed by Triangly and MicG.

# Overview
Have you ever wanted to have Tails, Knuckles, Sonic, Or even your own characters follow you around in wacky stages in your very own Sonic fangame? Well now you
can with this little addon I made that basically replicates the AI seen from Sonic 2, Sonic 3 and to some extend, Sonic Mania. 

# Little Disclaimer
This is coded by me without the use of the actual 68k ASM code as I can't read it. Nor the decompliation of Sonic Mania. However if you are someone that can 
understand the 68k ASM code, I would be happy to work with you! if not, that's fine.
